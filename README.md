# NBA-All-Stars-Analysis
Final Project (creative/open-ended) for my MTH123 "Math for Data Science" course at Tufts University. NBA All-Star player data was analyzed through utilization of PCA, Sparse PCA and clustering. 

## Python Libraries Used 
* NumPy : For array and matrix operations
* Pandas : For working with dataframes 
* sklearn : For PCA and regression models
* matplotlib: For plotting data 

## Data Used 
* Kaggle Dataset: NBA All Star Game 2000-2016 - www.kaggle.com/fmejia21/nba-all-star-game-20002016
* Kaggle Dataset: NBA Players - www.kaggle.com/justinas/nba-players-data

## Part 1: Feature Transformation and Classification
Question: Which feature transformation classifier pipeline can be constructed to predict whether a player becomes an all-star that season? 

Tested Pipelines were a combination of the following: 
Feature Transformations: Standard Scaler, PCA, Sparse PCA 
Classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVC 

## Part 2: PCA, K-Means Clustering and Visualization 
Question: What kind of players become all stars? Can they be categorized? 

## Process and Results
